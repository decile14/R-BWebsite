I chose to have the colors black, platinum, gold, and red because these colors remind me of the award colors and signs of success for an artist such as, "Beyonce's album went platinum". Also R&B is a sexy genre and I thought red, gold, and black emboddied the sexiness for the genre. I chose to use Lover's Quarrel because it looked like it could be the signature of an artist could be like. It also represents the seductive nature of the genre. The artist page is organized by their age/year of birth.
